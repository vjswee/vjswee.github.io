Designed semiconductor fab clean room ceiling emitter with built in microcontroller adjustable remotely by handheld infrared controller.

![disk drive mfg electrostatic blower](/assets/img/disk drive mfg electrostatic blower.png)

Designed, cost reduced and streamlined disk drive mfg electrostatic blower. Worked with mechanical engineers whoc designed a novel cleaning brush system for the emitters in blower. Saved the company during semiconductor market downturn by broadening the ionizer applications to disk drive manufacturing.

Worked with mechanical engineers to design a novel blow off electrostatic gun for disk drive and electronic manufacturing.

![electrostatic field meter](/assets/img/electrostatic field meter.png)

Worked with physicists and field engineers to streamline calibration procedures.


Worked with engineering, manufacturing and quality to implement ISO 9000, made many manufacuring improvements with cost saving and improved quality. Applied many of the Leadership through quality techniques learnt in Xerox.

Worked with Hamamatsu in Japan to develop a novel XRay ionizer. Worked with Japanese distriutor to understand flat panel manufacturing requirements for ionizers.



A few pictures of ionizers in action.
