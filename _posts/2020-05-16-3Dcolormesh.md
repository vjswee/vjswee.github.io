This example creates a three-dimensional plot showing how gamma changes relative to price for a Black-Scholes option. The plot in this example shows a three-dimensional surface whose z-value is the gamma of an option as price (x-axis) and time (y-axis) vary. The plot adds yet a fourth dimension by showing option delta (the first derivative of option price to security price) as the color of the surface.
