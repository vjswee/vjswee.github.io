The ALGO 5 Newborn Hearing Screener incorporates Natus proprietary AABR technology to achieve a complete physiologic screen of the hearing pathway from the ear to the brainstem.
I led the design team in both US and Germany which delivered the ALGO 5. It has an embedded  DSP processor to do the signal generation & processing which is passed on to a customized PC (on a portable stand) for user interface, hospital database integration and report generation.
