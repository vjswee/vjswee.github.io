Managed the early stage start up hardware, softwate, firmware and electromechanical design of Optiscan glucose monitoring system.

<h3>Measuring Glucose</h3>
Unlike other glucose monitoring systems that quantify plasma glucose using an enzymatic or reagent-based technique, the OptiScanner directly measures glucose from blood plasma with an integrated spectrometer. The OptiScanner provides an updated glucose reading every 15 minutes. Glycemic trends are displayed prominently, indicating whether patient’s glucose is stable (euglycemia), rising too high (hyperglycemia) or falling too low (hypoglycemia).
<h3>Plasma Collection</h3>
Measurements are made using a small blood sample drawn directly from the patient through a vascular access catheter. Less than 0.15 mL of the blood sample is retained for analysis, and the remaining blood is returned to the patient via a saline flush through the catheter. The retained sample is centrifuged to separate the red blood cells from the plasma. The plasma is then evaluated by the spectrometer to determine the glucose concentration.
<h3>Detecting Glucose</h3>
The system detects glucose by analyzing mid-infrared (MIR) light (7μm -10μm) absorption spectra. After obtaining the absorption spectrum for a specific sample, the system calculates blood glucose levels. Blood glucose results are displayed numerically and the trending data is plotted on the OptiScanner screen for ease of monitoring by healthcare providers. This method provides a robust, stable and reproducible analytical method for glucose measurement. Because the analysis is based on the physical absorption properties of glucose, readings from the OptiScanner are not subject to drift as they are with chemically based systems.
