Led the electronics design team (hardware, firmware and software) for Color Electrostatic plotters which have been described   as a high speed video recorder with a washing machine. The plotter had microcontrollers to control paper movement, toner delivery to fountains, high speed logic to rasterize the plots, high voltage ICs to develop image on a coated special paper or film. We were Beta sites for Altera and Xilinx when they were start ups. The plotters also had a controller which converted Calcomp, HPGL and Autocad drawing high level language to bitmap. Developed novel algorithms to move paper without (loosing alignment) four times without loosing registration to plot RGB and black colors to an accuracy of 400 dpi!
