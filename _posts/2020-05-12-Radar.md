Worked with Thomson CSF on S band long range radar receiver design. Trained in Paris Thomson CSF facility for 6 months in design
Learnt an interesting dicke fix design for protecting radar from jamming.

The basic configuration consists of a broadband limiting IF amplifier, followed by an IF amplifier of optimum bandwidth. The limit level is preset at approximately the peak amplitude of receiver noise, the bandwidth may vary from 10 to 20 MHz, depending on the jamming environment. This causes a constant false alarm rate over a wide range of the sweep. The “Dicke Fix”- radar signal processing provides excellent discrimination against fast sweep jamming (10–500 MHz), usually something on the order of 20 to 40 dB, without appreciable loss in sensitivity.
