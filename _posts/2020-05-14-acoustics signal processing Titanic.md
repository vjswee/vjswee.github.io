Designed the model 455 16 channel acoustic signal processor at Benthos which was used by WoodsHole Oceanographic Institute for acoustic navigation of autonomous remote piloted vehicle. It was used in research ship Knorr with ROV  Alvin to discover the Titanic. The coustic signal processor had 16 channels of analog signal processing. STD bus based microprocessor system was used to set up and analyze the travel time to plot distances.

Also doubled the life (from 6 months to 1 year) of underwater release. The release did not work in the field, but later they found the release worked perfectly but the payload got snagged in something else.
